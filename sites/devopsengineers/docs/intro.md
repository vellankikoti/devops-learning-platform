## 🎯 Our Vision

We believe in **practical, hands-on learning** that prepares you for real-world DevOps challenges. Every concept you learn here will be backed by:
- ✅ **Real-world examples** from production environments
- ✅ **Hands-on exercises** with actual deployments
- ✅ **Cloud-first approach** - AWS will be your playground throughout the journey
- ✅ **Always up-to-date** content with latest tool versions and best practices

## 🚀 Choose Your Learning Path

### **Path 1: I'm New to DevOps - Start from Basics**

If you're a complete beginner, follow this structured path to build a solid foundation:

1. **🐧 Linux Fundamentals** - Master the operating system that powers DevOps
2. **📜 Shell Scripting** - Automate tasks and build your scripting skills
3. **🔀 Git & GitHub** - Learn version control and collaboration
4. **🔧 Jenkins CI/CD** - Build your first automation pipelines
5. **⚙️ Ansible Automation** - Manage infrastructure with configuration management
6. **🐳 Docker Containerization** - Package applications in containers
7. **☸️ Kubernetes Orchestration** - Deploy and scale containerized apps
8. **☁️ AWS for DevOps** - Deploy everything to the cloud
9. **🏗️ Terraform Infrastructure as Code** - Manage cloud infrastructure programmatically

**[Start with Linux Fundamentals →](/docs/linux/intro)**

> 💡 **Note**: Throughout your learning journey, you'll use **AWS cloud** for deployments and hands-on practice. Every module includes AWS integration examples.

### **Path 2: I Know DevOps - Upskill in AWS & Cloud**

If you already have DevOps experience and want to specialize in AWS and cloud technologies:

1. **☁️ AWS for DevOps** - Deep dive into AWS services for DevOps engineers
2. **🏗️ Terraform Infrastructure as Code** - Provision AWS infrastructure with code
3. **☸️ Kubernetes on AWS (EKS)** - Run Kubernetes in the cloud
4. **🐳 Docker & AWS ECR** - Container registry and deployment on AWS

**[Start with AWS for DevOps →](/docs/aws/intro)**

### **Path 3: I Want to Learn Specific Tools**

Jump directly to any technology you want to master:

- **[☁️ AWS](/docs/aws/intro)** - Cloud infrastructure and services
- **[🐧 Linux](/docs/linux/intro)** - System administration fundamentals
- **[📜 Shell Scripting](/docs/shell-scripting/intro)** - Automation and scripting
- **[🔀 Git & GitHub](/docs/git-github/intro)** - Version control
- **[🔧 Jenkins](/docs/jenkins/intro)** - CI/CD pipelines
- **[⚙️ Ansible](/docs/ansible/intro)** - Configuration management
- **[🐳 Docker](/docs/docker/intro)** - Containerization
- **[☸️ Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes/intro)** - Container orchestration
- **[🏗️ Terraform](/docs/terraform/intro)** - Infrastructure as Code

## ☁️ Cloud-First Learning Approach

**AWS is integrated throughout your learning journey:**

- Every deployment exercise uses **AWS cloud infrastructure**
- Linux servers run on **AWS EC2 instances**
- Containers are deployed to **AWS ECS and EKS**
- CI/CD pipelines integrate with **AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild**
- Infrastructure is provisioned using **AWS services with Terraform**
- Monitoring and logging use **AWS CloudWatch**

You'll learn DevOps tools **while building real cloud infrastructure** - exactly like production environments.

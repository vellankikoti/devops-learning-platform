**You've learned Docker. From zero to hero. That's your journey. This is your summary.**

## 🎯 What You've Learned

**You've mastered:**

**Fundamentals:**
- What Docker is and why it matters
- Docker architecture
- Images and containers
- Networking and volumes

**Advanced:**
- Docker Compose (2025 standards)
- Security best practices
- Production deployment
- Performance tuning
- Troubleshooting

**Real-World:**
- Complete applications
- CI/CD pipelines
- Production checklists
- Best practices

**Think of it as:** Complete journey. From beginner to expert.

## Key Concepts

**Images:**
- Templates for containers
- Built from Dockerfiles
- Stored in registries
- Optimized with multi-stage builds

**Containers:**
- Running instances of images
- Isolated environments
- Managed lifecycle
- Connected via networks

**Compose:**
- Multi-container applications
- Configuration as code
- 2025 standards (no version field)
- Production-ready

**Security:**
- Non-root users
- Secrets management
- Image scanning
- Network isolation

**Production:**
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Backup
- Scaling

## The Complete Picture

**Docker ecosystem:**

**Development:**
- Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose
- Local development

**Build:**
- Dockerfiles
- BuildKit
- Multi-stage builds

**Deploy:**
- Registries
- CI/CD
- Orchestration

**Production:**
- Monitoring
- Security

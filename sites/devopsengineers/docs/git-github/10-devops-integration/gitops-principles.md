# GitOps Principles: Git as Source of Truth

**GitOps uses Git as the source of truth. Understanding GitOps is understanding modern infrastructure management.**

## 🎯 The Big Picture

GitOps stores infrastructure and application code in Git. Git becomes the source of truth. Changes to Git trigger deployments. Everything is version controlled.

**Think of it like this: GitOps is like Infrastructure as Code, but Git is the control plane. Git changes trigger infrastructure changes.**

## GitOps Principles

1. **Git as Source of Truth** - Everything in Git
2. **Declarative Configuration** - Describe desired state
3. **Automated Deployment** - Git changes trigger deployments
4. **Observable** - Monitor and verify

## GitOps Workflow

1. Developer commits to Git
2. CI/CD pipeline runs
3. Infrastructure updated
4. System converges to desired state

## My Take: GitOps Is the Future

GitOps is the future of infrastructure. Git becomes the control plane. Everything is version controlled.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Git as source of truth** - Everything in Git
2. **Declarative** - Describe desired state
3. **Automated** - Git changes trigger deployments
4. **Observable** - Monitor and verify
5. **Version controlled** - Full history

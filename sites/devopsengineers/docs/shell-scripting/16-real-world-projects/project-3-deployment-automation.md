# Project 3: Deployment Automation System

Build deployment automation. Build. Test. Deploy. Real project.

**Here's the thing: Deployment automation is essential. Build it. Learn from it.**

## Features

- Build application
- Run tests
- Deploy to server
- Verify deployment

## Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Deployment script
# Builds, tests, and deploys application

deploy() {
    build
    test
    deploy_to_server
    verify
}
```

**My take**: Build projects. Learn from them.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand deployment automation, let's talk about [Project 4: Monitoring Dashboard](/docs/shell-scripting/real-world-projects/project-4-monitoring-dashboard).

> **Personal note**: Projects teach you. Build them. Learn from them. They're valuable.

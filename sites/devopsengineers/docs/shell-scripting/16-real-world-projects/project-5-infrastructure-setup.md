# Project 5: Infrastructure Provisioning

Build infrastructure setup. Provision servers. Configure them. Real project.

**Here's the thing: Infrastructure setup is essential. Build it. Learn from it.**

## Features

- Provision servers
- Configure services
- Setup networking
- Verify setup

## Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Infrastructure setup
# Provisions and configures infrastructure

setup_infrastructure() {
    provision_servers
    configure_services
    setup_networking
    verify_setup
}
```

**My take**: Build projects. Learn from them.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand infrastructure setup, you've completed all projects. Review what you've learned. You're ready.

> **Personal note**: Projects teach you. Build them. Learn from them. They're valuable.

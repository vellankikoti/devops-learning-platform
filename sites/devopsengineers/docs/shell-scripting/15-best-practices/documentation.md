# Documentation: Write Good Docs

Document scripts. Comments. README. Inline docs. Important.

**Here's the thing: Documentation helps others. And you. Write it.**

## Comments

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script does something
# Author: Your Name
# Date: 2024-01-01
```

**My take**: Comments explain code. Write them.

## README

```markdown
# Script Name

Description of what it does.

## Usage

./script.sh arg1 arg2
```

**My take**: README explains usage. Write it.

## Common Patterns

### Header Comment

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Script: script.sh
# Purpose: Does something
# Author: Your Name
#
```

## What's Next?

Now that you understand documentation, let's talk about [Testing Scripts](/docs/shell-scripting/best-practices/testing-scripts).

> **Personal note**: Documentation seemed unnecessary at first. Then I needed it. Now I write it always. It helps. Write it.
